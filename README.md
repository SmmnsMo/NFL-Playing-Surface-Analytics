# NFL-Playing-Surface-Analytics
This is a passion project dedicated to analyzing the playing surfaces and how that affects the NFL athletes performances and examining the factors that may contribute to lower extremity issues. The dataset and direction originates from an [NFL Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-playing-surface-analytics/overview). 

# Description 
In the NFL athletes are very vocal about their preference to play on grass fields. There are studies indicate significantly higher injury rates on lower extremities for synthetic turf fields as opposed to natural (Mack et al., 2018; Loughran et al., 2019). Biomechanical studeies of cleat-surface show that synthetic turf does not release cleats as readily as natural surfaces and may contribute to non-contact lower limb injuries (Kent et al., 2015). Given these two studies, the NFL was interested in examining the effects of playing on synthetic turf versus natural turf.
